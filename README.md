I am a Full Stack Developer, I primarily work on frontend development with JavaScript and TypeScript using different frameworks like React.js, Next.js, and Remix.

Also I work on backend development using Node.js and Express and I can build real time applications with WebSockets. I have experience working with various services to deploy scalable applications on cloud platforms such as Cloudflare, AWS, Azure and DigitalOcean. For databases, Iâ€™ve worked with MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Redis and Prisma as my ORM.

On the DevOps side, I have experience with GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, Ansible, Kafka and Datadog for monitoring applications.
